Data Correlation Analysis




















This repository provides tools for performing correlation analysis on datasets to identify relationships between different variables. Understanding correlations helps in exploring dependencies and making informed decisions in data-driven projects.






















Key Features:























Correlation Coefficients: Compute Pearson, Spearman, or Kendall correlations to quantify relationships between pairs of variables.




















Correlation Heatmaps: Visualize correlations across variables using heatmap plots.






















Statistical Significance: Evaluate the significance of correlations to determine if relationships are statistically meaningful.


























These tools facilitate the exploration of how variables interact and influence each other within your dataset.
